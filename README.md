# go-starfighter

A go-based, untested, written at 1am client to the stockfighter.io/starfighter.io API.

Because, you know, the service keeps going up and down because of demand, so while I can't access it, let's make a client!

I will probably look back on this horrible code/decision in the morning.

## Using

Straightforward, based on the API itself. Just initialise a Client and go forth.

`go get github.com/robxu9/go-starfighter` will get you most of the way there.

## Bugs

Probably tons of them. File issues and/or pull requests, please.
